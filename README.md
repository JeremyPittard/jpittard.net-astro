# jpittard.net perpetually in development

This is is probably the 9000th version of jpittard.net, This as my personal code playground to try all the new shiny things and archive/chop/change this repository in a way that makes this easy. As such please consider it in perpetual development, even if it gets a bit quiet here and there. 

this iteration of the site 

- built with Astrojs
- diving into astrodb
- have a cms utilizing the above
- a tools section (eventually) for random web tools I end up making (eg the james hoffman french press recipe step by step)
- blog with the cms mentioned above


## roadmap 
- [] basic website deployed
- [] auth for cms

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
